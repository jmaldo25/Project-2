![Top 13 Reasons Collisions occur](reasonbyboroughfull.png)

When looking at the data, as you can tell most of the collisions occur in the busier boroughs.
With Brooklyn having the most collisions out of the boroughs.
When we look at the data even further, we notice that the leading cause in most of the borough is "Driver Inattention/
Distraction." Although more of the collisions are listed with an "Unspecified", which can be misleading...
either the actual factor could not be determined or that it simply was not a large enough collision to warrant
a designation. While we normally see New Yorkers as being aggressive and would think "Aggressive Driving/Road Rage"
would be near the top, it is actually in the middle or towards the bottom when it comes to the contributing factor.
Although, "Following Too Closely" was a top factor so even though Road Rage is not a top factor, people in New York
seem have a tendency to follow too closely, leading to collisions.
