      <p>When looking at the data, as you can tell most of the collisions occur in the busier boroughs.
          With Brooklyn having the most collisions out of the boroughs.
          When we look at the data even further, we notice that the leading cause in most of the borough is "Driver Inattention/
          Distraction." Although more of the collisions are listed with an "Unspecified", which can be misleading...
          either the actual factor could not be determined or that it simply was not a large enough collision to warrant
          a designation. While we normally see New Yorkers as being aggressive and would think "Aggressive Driving/Road Rage"
          would be near the top, it is actually in the middle or towards the bottom when it comes to the contributing factor.
          Although, "Following Too Closely" was a top factor so even though Road Rage is not a top factor, people in New York
          seem have a tendency to follow too closely, leading to collisions.
      </p>
      <p>
          While we did want to include the different types of vehicles that were involved in the collisions in New York,
          after sifting through the data we came to a conclusion... there are too many listings for the different vehicle types.
          It seems as though, when a collision was recorded there were various labels for the same type of vehicle involved.
          The larger project would be to consolidate all these different tags and roll them into one tag for each class. Due to
          time constraints this is a task that will take more time to dissect.
